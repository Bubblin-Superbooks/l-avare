There is no punishment great enough for the enormity of the crime; and if it remain unpunished, the most sacred things are no longer secure.</p><p>Off. In what coins was that sum?</p><p>Har. In good louis d'or and pistoles of full weight.</p><p>Off. Whom do you suspect of this robbery?</p><p>Har. Everybody. I wish you to take into custody the whole town and suburbs.</p><p>Off. You must not, if you trust me, frighten anybody, but must use gentle means to collect evidence, in order afterwards to proceed with more rigour for the recovery of the sum which has been taken from you.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
