Mr. Steward is mightily indispensable.</p><p>Har. Peace.</p><p>Jac. Sir, I can't bear these flatteries, and I can see that, whatever this man does, his continual watching after the bread, wine, wood, salt, and candles, is done but to curry favour and to make his court to you. I am indignant to see it all; and I am sorry to hear every day what is said of you; for, after all, I have a certain tenderness for you; and, except my horses, you are the person I like most in the world.</p><p>Har. And I would know from you, Master Jacques, what it is that is said of me.</p><p>Jac. Yes, certainly, Sir, if I were sure you would not get angry with me.</p><p>Har. No, no; never fear.</p><p>Jac. Excuse me, but I am sure you will be angry.</p></div> </div>
