It is true she is not at all to my taste; but, to please you, father, I will bring myself to marry her, if you please.</p><p>Har. If I please! I am more reasonable than you think. I don't wish to compel you.</p><p>Cle. Excuse me! I will make an attempt to love her.</p><p>Har. No, no; a marriage cannot be happy where there is no love.</p><p>Cle. That, my father, will, perhaps, come by and by, and it is said that love is often the fruit of marriage.</p><p>Har. No, it is not right to risk it on the side of the man, and there are some troublesome things I don't care to run the chance of. If you had felt any inclination for her, you should have married her instead of me, but as it is, I will return to my first intention and marry her myself.</p></div> </div>
