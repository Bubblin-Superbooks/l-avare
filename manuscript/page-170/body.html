No, Sir, it is not your wealth that has tempted me, it is not that which has dazzled me; and I swear never to pretend to any of your possessions, provided you leave me what I have.</p><p>Har. In the name of all the devils, no, I shall not leave it to you. But did anyone ever meet with such villainy! He wishes to keep what he has robbed me of!</p><p>Val. Do you call that a robbery?</p><p>Har. If I call that a robbery? A treasure like that!</p><p>Val. I readily acknowledge that it is a treasure, and the most precious one you have. But it will not be losing it to leave it to me. I ask you on my knees to leave in my possession this treasure so full of charms; and if you do right, you will grant it to me.</p><p>Har. I will do nothing of the kind. What in the world are you driving at?</p></div> </div>
