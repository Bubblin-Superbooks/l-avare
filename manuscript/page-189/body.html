<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>Har. Has nothing been taken out?</p><p>Cle. Nothing at all. Is it your intention to agree to this marriage, and to join your consent to that of her mother, who leaves her at liberty to do as she likes?</p><p>Mar. (<em>to</em> Cléante). But you do not know that this consent is no longer sufficient, and that heaven has given me back a brother (<em>showing</em> Valère), at the same time that it has given me back a father (<em>showing</em> Anselme); and you have now to obtain me from him.</p><p>Ans. Heaven, my dear children, has not restored you to me that I might oppose your wishes. Mr. Harpagon, you must be aware that the choice of a young girl is more likely to fall upon the son than upon the father. Come, now, do not force people to say to you what is unnecessary, and consent, as I do, to this double marriage.</p><p>Har. In order for me to be well advised, I must see my casket.</p></div> </div>
